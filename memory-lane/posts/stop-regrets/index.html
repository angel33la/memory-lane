                    I recently listened to an episode of Gary Vaynerchuk's podcast titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBC5hdI-YgA">Watch This If You're Regretting the Past</a>. In this episode, he shared a simple concept of just not living in regrets. No matter what it was that has you feeling some type of way, just forget about it and move on. His insights were incredibly inspiring and left a lasting impact on me.

                    <p>
                        Don't regret your past; I'd have to say is one that truly resonates with me. Regrets have been a constant companion in my life, and I can't recall a time when I haven't felt their weight. They've made my life and situations almost unbearable at times. There have been countless days and nights when I've been consumed by depression, haunted by the past and the endless cycle of regret. It's not something I'm proud of, but I'm finally free from that rut. I'm not sure if it's a permanent state, but I wake up each morning with a completely different mindset than before.
                    </p>

                    <p>Listening to GaryVee reminded me of all that. It's been a while since I've thought about those things, and I'm grateful that I did because it reignited the fire and determination within me. I do sometimes wonder why I'm even going back to school, but I know that my past has been filled with poor decisions and mistakes. I've experienced things that most people at Full Sail have never had to endure, all because of my own choices. But one day, I simply grew tired of being in a place where I wasn't happy and where I wasn't living a comfortable life. I still have to scrap day to day, barely making ends meet because of my background. Getting a decent job is so very hard for me, because of my background. So, I decided to cut off all the negative people in my life and pursue my dreams. I enrolled in college and I am on my way to getting a degree in a field that I'm passionate about and that I believe will be in demand in the future. Listening to GaryVee reminded me of my goals and the reasons behind them.</p>

                    <p>Living a life stuck in the past and burdened by regrets will ultimately lead you nowhere. The only person capable of transforming your life is you; no one else can do it for you. Therefore, the decision to rise and change your life is a choice solely yours to make. I made this decision for various reasons, and I will continue until I reach a point in my life where I am content and happy with my life. I refuse to be envious of others' lives; I want to live my own. Instead of waking up regretting the reasons and opportunities I missed in the past, I took a step forward, and here I am. Whether I will ever achieve my desired goals or fulfill my needs, I am not entirely certain. However, I am resolute in my determination not to waste any more of my life living in regrets and poor decisions.</p>
